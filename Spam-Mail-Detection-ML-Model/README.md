# Spam Detection Machine Learning Model

Welcome to my Spam Detection Machine Learning model! This project focuses on building an efficient Machine Learning model to detect spam emails and classify them as legitimate or spam.

## Introduction

Spam emails have become a significant issue in today's digital world. This project aims to address this problem using Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms, the model is trained to identify spam emails with high accuracy.


## Dataset

The model is trained and tested on a publicly available dataset of labeled emails. The dataset consists of two classes: 'spam' and 'ham' (non-spam). Each email is preprocessed to extract relevant features for model training.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
```
|-- project_directory/
|   |-- data/
|   |   |-- spam_ham_dataset.csv
|   |-- src/
|   |   |-- spam-mail-detection-model.py

```

## Sample Prediction

Test the trained model on new email samples by providing the email content in the `sample_text` variable in `spam-mail-detection-model.py`. The model will predict whether the email is spam or not.
